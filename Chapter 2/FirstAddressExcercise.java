//What is the purpose of the main method in this program? - Purpose of the main method is to serve as the starting point where the program begins.

//How does the displayAddress() method contribute to the overall output of the program? - By displaying the address information when it is called.

//What would happen if you removed the System.out.println("First Java application"); line from the main method? - The message "First Java application" would not be printed, but the program would still run normally without that output.
